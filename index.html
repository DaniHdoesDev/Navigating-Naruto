      This is all dedicated to my complete opinions on Naruto, Naruto Shippuden, and Boruto: Naruto Next Generations! 
      <p><em> I have spent the last few months watch Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I will be going through my favorite and least favorite characters. I will also unpack various moments in the shows.</em></p>
      <p><em> The characters I loved the most are: 
      <h2>5. Temari: </h2>
         She is strong willed. Also, she protects her brothers, Gaara and Kankuro, with everything she has. 

      <h2>4. Gaara: </h2>
         He completely transformed his outlook on life to become the youngest Kazekage. 

      <h2>3. Lady Tsunade: </h2>
         She is a brilliant medical. She became the first female Hokage of the Hidden Leaf village. 

      <h2>2. Shikamaru </h2>
         He is increbily intelligent and an amazing strategist. 

      <h2>1. Hinata: </h2>
         She overcame own shyness to become a better person and ninja.
